## Ephemeris files

This library does not include any ephemeris files. To use the Swiss Ephemeris files, download them from [https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/](https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/) and call `set_ephe_path()` to point the library to the folder containing the ephemeris files.

Each main ephemeris file covers a range of 600 years starting from the century indicated in its name, for example the file `sepl_18.se1` is valid from year 1800 until year 2400. The following files are available:

* sepl files - planets (AD)
* seplm files - planets (BC)
* semo files - moon (AD)
* semom files - moon (BC)
* seas files - main asteroids (AD)
* seasm files - main asteroids (BC)

For advanced usage, the following files can also be found:

* astxxx folders - files for individual asteroids (600 years)
* longfiles folder - files for individual asteroids (6000 years)
* jplfiles folder - files for NASA's JPL ephemerides
* sat folder - files for planetary moons

More information can be found in the [Swiss Ephemeris files documentation](https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/doc/swisseph.htm).

## Contributing

If you find any inaccuracy or bug in this library, or if you find an upstream update that is not yet included in this library, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Limitations

* While worker_threads are supported, the underlying C library is single threaded and contains process-wide settings. Functions such as `set_ephe_path()` or `set_sid_mode()` will affect the entire process, including all worker_threads. While you can still use worker_threads as long as you don't change settings from other threads in the middle of calculations, true thread-safe multithreading can only be achieved using child_process.

* This library is a C/C++ add-on designed for Node.JS only, it will not work in browsers, other JS engines or in any other environment that does not support native C/C++ add-ons. In order to install this library, the target system must have the necessary build tools installed, such as `python`, `make` and `gcc` on Linux, `xcode` on Mac, `visual c++` on Windows, and/or other equivalent solutions.
