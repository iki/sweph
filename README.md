## Ephemeris files

This library does not include any ephemeris files. To use the Swiss Ephemeris files, download them from [https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/](https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/) and call `set_ephe_path()` to point the library to the folder containing the ephemeris files.

Each main ephemeris file covers a range of 600 years starting from the century indicated in its name, for example the file `sepl_18.se1` is valid from year 1800 until year 2400. The following files are available:

* sepl files - planets (AD)
* seplm files - planets (BC)
* semo files - moon (AD)
* semom files - moon (BC)
* seas files - main asteroids (AD)
* seasm files - main asteroids (BC)
For advanced usage, the following files can also be found:
* astxxx folders - files for individual asteroids (600 years)
* longfiles folder - files for individual asteroids (6000 years)
* jplfiles folder - files for nasa's jpl ephemerides
* sat folder - files for planetary moons
More information can be found in the [Swiss Ephemeris files documentation](https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/doc/swisseph.htm#_Toc58931065).

## Contributing

If you find any innacuracy or bug in this library, or if you find an update that is not yet included in this library, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Known Issues and Caveats

* Due to how the underlying C library operates, you may find that the `error` field returned by some functions will contain random data even if there is no actual error. This can happen when existing memory buffers are recycled therefore the user must always check the returned flag values as per the Swiss Ephemeris documentation.
* While worker_threads are supported, the underlying C library is single threaded and its settings are global. Functions such as `set_ephe_path()` will affect the entire process, including worker_threads. While you can still use worker_threads as long as you dont change settings from other threads in the middle of calculations, true thead-safe multithreading can be achieved using child_process instead.
